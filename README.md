# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Machine Learning project to predict heart disease


# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate.  
This project helps in early detection and decision support using data-driven techniques.
